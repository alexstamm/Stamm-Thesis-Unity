The accessibility and flexibility of mobile devices make them an advantageous platform for
gaming, but there are hardware limitations that impede the rendering of high-quality graphics.
Rendering complex graphics on a mobile device typically results in a delayed image, also known
as latency, and is a great discomfort for users of any real-time rendering experience. This study
tests the image stream optimization View Bypass within a cloud gaming architecture, surpassing
this imposing limitation by processing the high-quality game render on a remote computational
server. A two sample for means test is performed to determine significance between two
treatments: the control group without the View Bypass algorithm and the experimental group
rendering with the View Bypass algorithm. A SSIM index score is calculated comparing the
disparity between the remote server image output and the final mobile device image output after
optimizations have been performed. This score indicates the overall image structural integrity
difference between the two treatments and determines the quality and effectiveness of the tested
algorithm.
